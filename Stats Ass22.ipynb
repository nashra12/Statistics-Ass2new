    "Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "Ans-> The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Median: The middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the set has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mode: The number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. A set can have more than one mode if multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the\n",
    "central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "Ans-> The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n",
    "    The mean is used when the data is symmetrically distributed without outliers, as it considers all values in the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Median: The middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the set has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "    The median is used when the data is skewed or contains outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mode: The number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. A set can have more than one mode if multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency. The mode is used for categorical data or when identifying the most common value is important. It is useful in understanding the most frequent occurrence in the data.\n",
    "Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:\n",
    " [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    " Ans-> Mean: 177.01875\n",
    "Median: 177.0\n",
    "Mode: 178\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:\n",
    "[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    "Ans-> approximately 1.791.79.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe\n",
    "the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "Ans-> The range gives a simple measure of the spread of data by indicating the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset. It provides a rough estimate of how much the data points vary.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset representing the daily temperatures (in degrees Celsius) of a city over a week: {20, 22, 19, 25, 18, 21, 23}.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The range = maximum value - minimum value = 25 - 18 = 7 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "    This tells us that the temperatures varied by 7 degrees Celsius over the week.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset. It provides a more precise measure of dispersion compared to range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Using the same dataset of temperatures {20, 22, 19, 25, 18, 21, 23}:\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, calculate the mean: Mean=20+22+19+25+18+21+237=21Mean=720+22+19+25+18+21+23​=21.\n",
    "    Then, calculate the variance:\n",
    "    Variance=(20−21)2+(22−21)2+(19−21)2+(25−21)2+(18−21)2+(21−21)2+(23−21)27\n",
    "    Variance=7(20−21)2+(22−21)2+(19−21)2+(25−21)2+(18−21)2+(21−21)2+(23−21)2​\n",
    "    Variance=1+1+4+16+9+0+47=35/7=5\n",
    "    Variance=71+1+4+16+9+0+4​=735​=5\n",
    "    So, the variance of the temperatures is 5 square degrees Celsius.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Using the variance calculated above (variance = 5):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Standard deviation = rooot 5≈2.24\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the temperatures typically deviate from the mean by approximately 2.24 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "Ans->A Venn diagram is a graphical representation that illustrates the relationships and logical connections between different sets of items or groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:\n",
    "(i) A intersection B\n",
    "2,6\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B\n",
    "(0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "Ans-.  It indicates whether the data is concentrated more on one side of the mean than the other\n",
    "1)Positive Skewness (Right Skewness): and\n",
    "2)Negative Skewness (Left Skewness):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "Ans->The mean will be greater than the median because the presence of higher values (outliers) on the right side increases the mean.\n",
    "The median will be less than the mean because it is less affected by these higher values and more representative of the central tendency of the bulk of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in\n",
    "statistical analysis?\n",
    "Ans-> Covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Definition: Covariance measures how two variables vary together. Specifically, it indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables (positive or negative) and the strength of that relationship.\n",
    "    Formula: For two variables XX and YY with nn observations:\n",
    "    Cov(X,Y)=summation of i=1 to n(1/n(Xi−Xˉ)(Yi−Yˉ))\n",
    "    Cov(X,Y)=1∑1/n(Xi−Xˉ)(Yi−Yˉ)\n",
    "    where XˉXˉ and YˉYˉ are the means of XX and YY, respectively\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.\n",
    "    A negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease\n",
    "    \n",
    "Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Definition: Correlation also measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. However, it is standardized to always lie between -1 and +1, which makes it easier to interpret compared to covariance.\n",
    "    Formula: The correlation coefficient r between two variables X and Y is given by:\n",
    "    r=Cov(X,Y)/σX*σY\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a\n",
    "dataset. \n",
    "Ans-> The sample mean, denoted as Xˉ, is a measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of observations n.\n",
    "Example Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset of exam scores: {85, 90, 88, 92, 95, 87}\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the sample mean Xˉ:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add all the values in the dataset:\n",
    "    85+90+88+92+95+87=537\n",
    "\n",
    "    Count the number of observations n:\n",
    "    n=6\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate the sample mean Xˉ:\n",
    "    Xˉ=537/6=89.5\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "Ans->  For a normal distribution, which is a symmetric bell-shaped distribution, the measures of central tendency—mean, median, and mode—have a specific relationship:\n"
